# Experiments
Random experiements in Haskell.

All single file small program development.

## Compiling
Some stuff may or may not compile here. Packages needed to compile things also
questionable, especially for the stuff in **old**. At some point I decided that
I wanted to use stack scripts for most stuff like this so that I could still
compile it all eventually. So stuff in folders other than old is hopefully a
stack script and is pretty runnable.

## Organization
**old** is stuff that I have no idea how compilable it is from a long time ago.
In general stuff is a little bit organized. No guarantees on how much stuff is
actually organized.
